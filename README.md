# HelloDroid

HelloDroid is an application project that I use to test out new technologies provided by the
Android platform.

## Building

Currently, this project is using the gradle build system supported by Android. Also it is preferable if the IntelliJ IDEA environment is used. First checkout the latest code:

        $ git checkout http://github.com/figitaki/hello-droid

And then import the project into the IntelliJ IDEA and compile it.
